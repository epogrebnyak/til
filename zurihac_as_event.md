We have masters program at MGIMO on event management focusing on congresses, shows, festivals, exhibitions - the live events, 
as they are argueably harder to organize - need to move a lot of stuff around, lots of preparations, logistics.
But we have plenty of live events in the pandemic - but organising and running them is also a skill to be taught.
I'm participating in #Zurihac and enjor the atmophere, content and logistics on Discord - soemthign that takes skill 
and expereince to run.
